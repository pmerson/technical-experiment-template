# Experiment N: brief title of the experiment 
 

## Results and recommendations 
TO-DO: record here the partial or final conclusions and results of the technical experiment. 

## Objective 
TO-DO: describe here the objectives that motivated this technical experiment. Usually, a design decision will be made based on the results of the experiment. 
Explain what decision that is and what system(s) will be affected. Hint: try to articulate the objective as a technical question that you need to answer. 
Example: what is the minimum bandwidth for my app to stream video at 25 fps on HD?
